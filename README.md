Prototype concept-level rule-driven restricted language understanding machine

Concept-level : The machine breaks down input into concepts. A concept is a small data structure with a name, type and various other properties
Rule-driven : Responses and actions are generated by fixed rules based on name/type pattern in the input
Restricted : The machine cannot possibly reproduce all kinds of behaviors due to many reasons. One being the lack of contextual mapping.

Current Progress:
Basic concept rw & operations
